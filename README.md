# Telegram Camera Capture

Capture images and videos from a web camera using a motion detection engine and stream it remotely via Telegram.

Running this program on your computer, you can start asking your Telegram Bot to capture images and send them to your chat. Bots can be added to a group, such as a family telegram group, so that images captured can be shared with your family or friends.

   To use this program, you must first save your bot token (search @BotFather on your telegram application) to a file named _CameraCaptureBotToken_ in the same folder as you jar file.
