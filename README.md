<h1>Telegram Camera Capture</h1>

This program allows you to capture images from your web-camera and see it via your Telegram account.

To use this program, you must first save your bot token (search BotFather on your telegram application) to a file named <i>CameraCaptureBotToken</i> in the same folder as you jar file.

Running this program on your computer, you can start asking your Telegram Bot to capture images and send them to your chat. Bots can be added to a group, such as a family telegram group, so that images captured can be shared with your family or friends.
